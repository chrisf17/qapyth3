# PROBLEM:    Represent dogs and cats so that they can eat and speak.

# TODO. write the classes Dog and Cat
# ... so that the following code runs without error
fido = Dog('fido')
fluffy = Cat('fluffy')

fido.eat(100)

fido.speak()  # woof!
fluffy.speak()  # purr!

print('Fido weighs... {} g'.format(fido.weight))  # fido weighs 100 g


# EXTRA:

# Q. how could you use inheritance to simplify these definitions?
